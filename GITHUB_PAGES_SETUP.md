# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Good News! 🎉

Your PWA has been pushed to GitHub and the automatic deployment workflow is set up!

## Current Status

✅ Code pushed to GitHub  
✅ GitHub Actions workflow created  
✅ PWA built and ready  

## Next Steps

### 1. Check GitHub Actions Status

Visit: https://github.com/Hit1009/pee_meter/actions

You should see a workflow running called "Deploy Flutter Web to GitHub Pages". Wait for it to complete (usually 2-5 minutes).

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

Once the workflow completes:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Hit1009/pee_meter/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: Select **"Deploy from a branch"**
   - Branch: Select **"gh-pages"**
   - Folder: Select **"/ (root)"**
3. Click **"Save"**

### 3. Access Your PWA

After a few minutes, your app will be live at:

**🌐 https://hit1009.github.io/pee_meter/**

## Alternative: Use a Different Service

If you prefer easier deployment, try these:

### Option A: Netlify (Easiest!)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Drag and drop the `build/web` folder
3. Done! Your app is live instantly

### Option B: Vercel
```powershell
npm install -g vercel
cd build/web
vercel --prod
```

### Option C: Firebase
```powershell
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init hosting
firebase deploy
```

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Actions Failed?
- Check the Actions tab for error messages
- Make sure the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

### GitHub Pages Not Working?
- Wait 5-10 minutes after enabling
- Check that gh-pages branch exists
- Clear your browser cache

### Still Having Issues?
Use Netlify instead - it's the simplest option:
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Drag `build/web` folder
3. Your app is live in seconds!

## What Happens Automatically

Every time you push to the `main` branch:
1. GitHub Actions builds your Flutter web app
2. Automatically deploys to GitHub Pages
3. Your PWA is updated at https://hit1009.github.io/pee_meter/

No manual deployment needed! 🎉

## Manual Rebuild (if needed)

If you make changes:
```powershell
# Rebuild
flutter build web --release --pwa-strategy=offline-first

# Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Update PWA"
git push origin main

# GitHub Actions will auto-deploy!
```
