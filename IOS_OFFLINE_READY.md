## 🌟 Features

### Service Worker Features
- **Cache-first strategy**: Instant offline loading
- **Runtime caching**: Automatically caches as you use
- **Smart updates**: Checks for new versions periodically
- **iOS-compatible**: Works around iOS Safari limitations

### iOS Optimizations
- Network status detection with visual banner
- Prevents pull-to-refresh in standalone mode
- Safe area support for notch devices
- Optimized touch handling
- Update prompts for new versions

## 🔍 Verify It's Working

### In Safari Developer Tools (Desktop):
1. Connect iPhone to Mac
2. Open Safari → Develop → [Your iPhone] → [Your PWA]
3. Console tab → Look for "ServiceWorker registration successful"
4. Application tab → Check Cache Storage

### On Device:
- Look for "Offline Mode" banner when disconnected
- App should load instantly even when offline
- All features should work without internet

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **HTTPS Required**: PWAs and Service Workers require HTTPS
2. **Must Use Safari**: Only Safari can install PWAs on iOS
3. **First Visit Online**: Initial install requires internet
4. **Storage Limits**: iOS may clear cache if device is low on space

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**PWA won't install?**
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled
- Clear Safari cache
- Try from Safari (not Chrome)

**Offline mode not working?**
- Check service worker registration in console
- Verify sw.js is accessible at root URL
- Make sure app was opened at least once online

**Data not saving?**
- Check iOS Settings → Safari → Advanced → Website Data
- Disable "Prevent Cross-Site Tracking" for your domain
