# 🍎 iOS PWA Deployment Guide

## Important for iOS Safari!

iOS Safari requires PWAs to be served from a **root domain**, not a subdirectory.

❌ **Won't work on iOS**: `https://hit1009.github.io/pee_meter/`  
✅ **Works on iOS**: `https://pee-meter.netlify.app` or custom domain

## Best Deployment Options for iOS PWA

### 🥇 Option 1: Netlify (Recommended - Easiest!)

**Why Netlify?**
- ✅ Gives you a root domain automatically
- ✅ Free HTTPS
- ✅ Instant deployment
- ✅ Perfect for iOS PWA

**How to Deploy:**

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com and sign up/login

2. Click "Add new site" > "Deploy manually"

3. Drag and drop your `build/web` folder

4. Done! You'll get a URL like: `https://random-name-12345.netlify.app`

5. **Customize your URL** (optional):
   - Site settings > Change site name
   - Rename to something like: `pee-meter.netlify.app`

**Your PWA will work perfectly on iOS!** 🎉

### 🥈 Option 2: Vercel (Also Excellent!)

**Why Vercel?**
- ✅ Root domain provided
- ✅ Free HTTPS
- ✅ Great performance
- ✅ CLI deployment

**How to Deploy:**

```powershell
# Install Vercel CLI (one-time)
npm install -g vercel

# Go to project root (NOT build/web!)
cd c:\Users\hitar\Downloads\pee-meter\pee_meter

# Deploy
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? Yes
# - Which scope? (choose your account)
# - Link to existing project? No
# - Project name? pee-meter (or your choice)
# - In which directory is your code located? ./
# - Want to override settings? Yes
# - Output directory? build/web
# - Build command? flutter build web --release --pwa-strategy=offline-first

# For production deployment
vercel --prod
```

You'll get: `https://pee-meter.vercel.app` (or similar)

### 🥉 Option 3: Firebase Hosting with Custom Domain

GitHub Pages requires a subdirectory which doesn't work well with iOS PWA. Instead:

**Option A: Use Firebase with your own domain**

```powershell
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login
firebase login

# Initialize
firebase init hosting

# Set 'build/web' as public directory
# Configure as single-page app: Yes

# Deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

You'll get: `https://your-project.web.app`

**Option B: Add custom domain to GitHub Pages**
1. Buy a domain (e.g., from Namecheap, Google Domains)
2. Configure it in GitHub Pages settings
3. Use root domain (not subdirectory)
