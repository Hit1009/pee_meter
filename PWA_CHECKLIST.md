## 📝 Notes

**HTTPS Requirement**: PWAs require HTTPS in production (localhost is OK for testing)

**iOS Compatibility**: Requires iOS 11.3+ and Safari browser for installation

**Service Worker Updates**: After code changes, rebuild with:
```powershell
flutter build web --release --pwa-strategy=offline-first
```
